# Community Pool

Under the [x/distribution module](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/modules/distribution#reward-to-the-community-pool) of the Cosmos SDK, the `community tax` specifies that a fraction of the fees can be reserved for the given chain's community pool.&#x20;

On August 3, 2023, dYdX Trading [announced](https://dydx.exchange/blog/v4-rewards-and-parameters) that the dYdX v4 open source software would initially reflect a `community tax` of 0%. Notably, the `community tax` parameter is subject to adjustments by the [x/gov module](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/modules/gov) by the dYdX community and can be set to different values at Genesis by any deployer of the dYdX v4 open source software.&#x20;
