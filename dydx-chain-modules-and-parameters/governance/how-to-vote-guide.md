# How to Vote Guide

## Overview

Below, we provide a step-by-step guide to explain to new users of the dYdX Chain how to cast a vote on a governance proposal through a wallet extension.

Note, only bonded DYDX tokens can vote on dYdX Chain governance proposals, and this guide was created with the assumption that you have bonded DYDX tokens.&#x20;

To get bonded DYDX tokens, you will need to stake your tokens to your preferred validator(s). Visit this [page](../staking/how-to-stake-guide.md) for further information on staking.
