# How to Unstake Guide

## Overview

DYDX holders who stake DYDX to a validator can send a transaction to unstake and remove their tokens from being staked to a validator. After this transaction, the DYDX tokens enter an unbonding period. During the unbonding period, stakers can choose to delegate to a separate validator without having to wait for the unbonding period to elapse. However, a user’s slashing risk with the original validator remains until the unbonding period concludes.&#x20;

* 1(d) Note, you will need to wait for the unbonding period of 30 days (as of writing this guide, subject to governance) to end for your DYDX to be liquid.

## _Step 2 - New balance_

Once you unstake, you will see your available balance updated on the dashboard and you can restake these unstaked DYDX tokens with the same validator or select another validator to stake.
